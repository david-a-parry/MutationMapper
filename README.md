# MutationMapper

MutationMapper is built to help simplify determining the functional consequences of mutations discovered using low-throughput sequencing methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing) and to map CDS coordinates to genomic positions. For details of how to use MutationMapper see the instructions PDF available using the 'help' option in the application or available [here](https://github.com/gantzgraf/MutationMapper/blob/master/src/com/github/mutationmapper/instructions.pdf).


MutationMapper uses Ensemblâ€™s REST API to search genes, sequences and determine functional consequences of mutations. It therefore only works when an internet connection is available.
